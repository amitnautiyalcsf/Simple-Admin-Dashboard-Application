# Simple-Admin-Dashboard-Application
This application is based on Admin controls where Admin can create role/user, delete role/user, Update role/user, here i am using MySql as a database and C# as a programming language. Tables Which are used are TM_ROLEMASTER which contains Entries like RoleName , Role Description where RoleName is Primary key and another table which i created in SSMS is TM_USERMASTER which contains entries like userName(primaryKey) ,password and roleName(Foreign key). The Whole  simple application is built on windows forms which gives it as a Dashboard like look, and i use Stored Procedures for CRUD operations.
